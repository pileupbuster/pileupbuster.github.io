## 🧪 Validation & Testing

### Comprehensive Testing Completed
✅ **Connection Management**: WebSocket connections, authentication, disconnection  
✅ **Message Protocol**: All message types, validation, error handling  
✅ **Public Operations**: Queue operations working against real database  
✅ **Admin Operations**: Authenticated admin operations functional  
✅ **Event Broadcasting**: Real-time events delivered to all connected clients  

### Final Test Results (Phase 5)
```
📊 Event Integration Test Results:
   Authentication: ✅ SUCCESS (proper admin credentials)
   System Activation Events: 1 ✅ 
   Queue Operation Events: 1 ✅  (with full QRZ data)
   Admin Operation Events: 1 ✅  (frequency updates)
   
✅ Phase 5 Event Integration: SUCCESS - Events broadcasting to WebSocket clients!
