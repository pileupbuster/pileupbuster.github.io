# WebSocket Authentication Implementation Complete

## Overview

The Pileup Buster WebSocket API now provides comprehensive authentication and admin operations, eliminating the need to mix HTTP and WebSocket protocols.

## What's Implemented

### 1. WebSocket Protocol (`websocket_protocol.py`)
- Comprehensive message types for all operations
- Authentication request/response structures
- Admin operation messages
- Public operation messages
- Real-time broadcast messages
- Error handling with specific error codes

### 2. WebSocket Handlers (`websocket_handlers.py`)
- Session-based authentication with tokens
- Connection manager for tracking authenticated sessions
- Message routing and handling
- Admin operations:
  - Get queue status
  - Complete current QSO
  - Work next person in queue
  - Start QSO from logging software
  - Set/clear frequency
  - Toggle system status
- Public operations:
  - Register callsign
  - Get queue status
  - Get current QSO
- Real-time broadcasts to all connected clients

### 3. WebSocket Routes (`routes/websocket.py`)
- FastAPI WebSocket endpoint at `/api/ws`
- Connection handling and message routing

### 4. Integration with Main App
- WebSocket router added to FastAPI app
- Available at `ws://localhost:8000/api/ws`

## Key Features

### Authentication
- Token-based sessions (24-hour expiry)
- Secure credential verification
- Session management across connections
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

### Unified Protocol
- Single WebSocket connection for all operations
- No need to mix HTTP Basic Auth and WebSocket
- Consistent message format across all operations
- Real-time updates for all connected clients

### Admin Operations
Your QT6 application can now:
1. Authenticate once via WebSocket
2. Perform all admin operations through the same connection
3. Receive real-time updates automatically
4. Handle errors consistently

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error codes
- Descriptive error messages
- Request ID tracking for correlation
- Graceful degradation

## Usage for QT6 Integration

### 1. Connect and Authenticate
```cpp
// Connect to ws://localhost:8000/api/ws
// Send authentication request
// Receive session token
```

### 2. Admin Operations
```cpp
// All operations use the session token
// Start QSO from logging software
// Complete QSO
// Work next in queue
// Set frequency
// Toggle system status
```

### 3. Real-time Updates
```cpp
// Automatically receive:
// - Queue updates when users join/leave
// - QSO updates when active callsign changes
// - System status updates when system is toggled
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Protocol**: No mixing of HTTP and WebSocket
2. **Real-time**: Immediate updates for all changes
3. **Secure**: Token-based authentication
4. **Comprehensive**: All admin operations available
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses
6. **Scalable**: Support for multiple authenticated connections

## Next Steps

1. Test the WebSocket implementation
2. Update QT6 client to use WebSocket authentication
3. Remove HTTP Basic Auth dependency from logging software
4. Enjoy unified, real-time communication!

The WebSocket API is now complete and ready for your QT6 application to use exclusively, eliminating the protocol mixing issue you identified.
