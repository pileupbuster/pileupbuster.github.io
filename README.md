## Acknowledgments

This idea is not unique - we first noticed it being used by the Australian DX helper website developed by Greg and Grant. Kudos to them for the innovative approach! Check out their excellent work in the amateur radio community. The first working versions of Pileupbuster were designed and built by BrianBruff and all credit goes to him for that. I (Ei6JGB, Daithi) have since taken over the project and will be developing it further.

## Project Goals

### Core Objectives
- **Interactive Experience**: Real-time updates without manual page refreshing
- **100% AI-Driven Development**: All design elements (sketches, logos, website, features, issue design, and implementation) powered by AI
- **Single-User Focus**: Designed as a personal tool rather than multi-tenant platform (while multi-tenancy could be easily implemented, maintaining a platform for third parties is not the current goal)

### Technical Goals
- **Universal Deployment**: Support deployment on cloud platforms, any server, or local environments
- **Containerization**: Full Docker support for easy deployment and development
- **Modern Frontend**: Single-page React application hosted on GitHub Pages
- **Embedded Integration**: Backend status page designed for iframe integration (e.g., QRZ.com profiles - see https://www.qrz.com/db/EI6JGB)
- **Scalable Architecture**: Clean separation between frontend and backend services
- **Developer Experience**: Streamlined development workflow with hot-reload and modern tooling

### Software Quality Goals
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage
- **Documentation**: Clear setup guides, API documentation, and contributor guidelines
- **Code Quality**: Consistent coding standards and automated linting
- **Security**: Secure authentication and data protection
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast load times and responsive user experience
- **Maintainability**: Clean, modular code architecture for long-term sustainability

## Quick Start

### üê≥ Docker (Recommended)

Run the complete application with Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/brianbruff/pileup-buster.git
cd pileup-buster

# Start all services
docker compose up -d
```

Services will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000
- MongoDB: localhost:27017

For development with hot-reload:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

See [Docker Setup Guide](docs/DOCKER.md) for detailed instructions.

### Manual Setup

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend

# Install Poetry if not already installed
pip install poetry

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run backend server
poetry run uvicorn app.app:app --reload
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`
2. Configure the environment variables as described below

#### Environment Variables

| Variable         | Purpose                              | Required | Example                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| MONGO_URI        | MongoDB connection string            | Yes      | mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster... |
| SECRET_KEY       | Secret key for the API               | Yes      | supersecretkey                     |
| ADMIN_USERNAME   | Admin interface login username       | Yes      | admin                              |
| ADMIN_PASSWORD   | Admin interface login password       | Yes      | password123                        |
| QRZ_USERNAME     | QRZ.com integration username         | No       | myqrzlogin                         |
| QRZ_PASSWORD     | QRZ.com integration password         | No       | myqrzpassword                      |
| MAX_QUEUE_SIZE   | Maximum number of entries in queue  | No       | 4                                  |

**Required Variables:**
- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB Atlas connection string or local MongoDB URI
- `SECRET_KEY`: Used for API authentication and security
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` & `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Credentials for accessing the admin interface

**Optional Variables:**
- `QRZ_USERNAME` & `QRZ_PASSWORD`: If not configured, QRZ.com lookups will return "not configured" message
- `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE`: Defaults to a reasonable limit if not specified

3. Ensure MongoDB Atlas cluster is accessible or set up local MongoDB

## API Endpoints
