# Worked Callers Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented the worked callers functionality as requested. When a user is worked (QSO completed), they are automatically added to a list of callers that includes their callsign, name, location, country, and QRZ image link. When the system is set to inactive, this database is automatically emptied.

## Files Modified

### 1. Backend Database Layer (`backend/app/database.py`)

**Added:**
- New `worked_callers_collection` MongoDB collection
- `add_worked_caller()` method - Stores caller info with duplicate handling
- `get_worked_callers()` method - Retrieves all worked callers
- `clear_worked_callers()` method - Empties the worked callers list
- `get_worked_callers_count()` method - Returns count of worked callers
- `complete_current_qso()` method - Completes QSO and adds to worked list
- Updated `set_system_status()` to clear worked callers when inactive

**Key Features:**
- Stores: callsign, name, location, country, QRZ image, timestamps, work count
- Handles duplicates by updating existing entries and incrementing work count
- Automatically clears when system is deactivated

### 2. Admin Routes (`backend/app/routes/admin.py`)

**Modified:**
- Updated `/qso/complete` endpoint to use new `complete_current_qso()` method
- Updated `/status` endpoint to include worked callers clearing information
- Added real-time broadcasting of worked callers updates

**Added:**
- `GET /admin/worked-callers` - View all worked callers (admin)
- `POST /admin/worked-callers/clear` - Manually clear worked callers (admin)

### 3. Public Routes (`backend/app/routes/public.py`)

**Added:**
- `GET /public/worked-callers` - Public endpoint to view worked callers
- Returns empty list when system is inactive

### 4. Events Service (`backend/app/services/events.py`)

**Added:**
- New `WORKED_CALLERS_UPDATE` event type
- `broadcast_worked_callers_update()` method for real-time updates

## Database Schema

### Worked Callers Collection
```javascript
{
  "callsign": "K0TEST",              // Uppercase callsign
  "name": "John Doe",                // From QRZ lookup
  "location": "Springfield, IL, USA", // From QRZ lookup  
  "country": "United States",        // From QRZ lookup
  "qrz_image": "https://...",        // QRZ photo URL
  "worked_timestamp": "2025-01-...", // Last worked (ISO)
  "first_worked": "2025-01-...",     // First worked (ISO)
  "times_worked": 2                  // Number of contacts
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Admin Endpoints (Authenticated)
- `GET /api/admin/worked-callers` - Get all worked callers
- `POST /api/admin/worked-callers/clear` - Clear worked callers
- `POST /api/admin/qso/complete` - Complete QSO (now adds to worked list)

### Public Endpoints  
- `GET /api/public/worked-callers` - View worked callers (public)

## Real-time Events

**SSE Event Type:** `worked_callers_update`

**Triggered When:**
- QSO is completed (adds to list)
- System is deactivated (clears list) 
- Admin manually clears list

## Workflow

1. **During Operation:**
   - User completes QSO via admin panel
   - System automatically adds caller to worked list with QRZ info
   - Real-time update sent to all connected clients
   - Duplicate contacts update existing entry with new timestamp

2. **System Deactivation:**
   - Admin sets system to inactive
   - Queue cleared (existing behavior)
   - Current QSO cleared (existing behavior)
   - **NEW:** Worked callers list cleared
   - All clients notified of empty worked callers list

## Testing

Created `test_worked_callers.py` to verify:
- Adding worked callers
- Handling duplicates
- Counting functionality
- System deactivation clearing

## Documentation

- **`WORKED_CALLERS_FEATURE.md`** - Comprehensive feature documentation
- **Updated `README.md`** - Added to features list

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Logging** - No manual entry required
2. **Rich Information** - Includes QRZ data automatically
3. **Duplicate Handling** - Smart management of repeat contacts
4. **Session-Based** - Clean slate for each activation
5. **Real-time Updates** - Frontend stays synchronized
6. **Public Visibility** - Visitors can see session activity

## Migration Notes

- **Non-breaking change** - All existing functionality preserved
- **Automatic setup** - New collection created when first used
- **No data migration** - Works with existing QSO data
- **Backward compatible** - Can be enabled/disabled as needed

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The worked callers feature seamlessly integrates with the existing QSO completion workflow while providing the requested functionality of tracking and automatically clearing worked stations.
